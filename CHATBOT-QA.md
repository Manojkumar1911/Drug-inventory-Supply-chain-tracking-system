### How do I navigate the dashboard?
The dashboard provides a comprehensive summary of your inventory status, including low stock alerts, expiring items, recent transfers, and visual indicators of inventory health by category.

## Inventory Management

### How do I add a new product?
To add a new product, navigate to the Products page and click the 'Add Product' button. Fill in essential details like name, SKU, category, quantity, unit, reorder level, and location. You can also add optional information like supplier, expiry date, and pricing.

To delete a product, find it in the Products page, click on the delete icon next to the item, and confirm the deletion in the dialog box. Note that this action cannot be undone and will permanently remove the product from your inventory.

### What is the reorder level?
The reorder level is the minimum quantity threshold that triggers a restock alert. Set this based on your usage patterns, lead times from suppliers, and how critical the item is. When stock falls below this level, the system will generate an alert.

## Transfers

### How do I create a transfer?
To create a transfer, navigate to the Transfers page and click 'New Transfer'. Select the source location, destination, products, and quantities to be transferred, then submit the request. Transfers require approval before they're completed.

## Alerts

### What types of alerts are there?
PharmaLink provides several types of alerts: low stock alerts when products fall below their reorder levels, expiry alerts for products nearing their expiration dates, and transfer recommendations to optimize inventory across locations.

### How do stock alerts work?
Stock alerts trigger when product quantities fall below their reorder levels. These are visible on the Alerts page and dashboard. Each alert shows the product name, current quantity, reorder level, and recommended order quantity.

### How do expiry alerts work?
Expiry alerts notify you when products are approaching their expiration dates. Configure the advance warning period in Settings. These alerts help prevent waste and ensure you dispense older stock first.

You can temporarily disable specific alert types in the Settings page under 'Notifications'. This can be done globally or for specific products. However, it's recommended to keep alerts enabled for better inventory management.
